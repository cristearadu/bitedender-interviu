# bitedender-interviu

This project has been written with Python and Gauge framework. At the interview we've had a small discussion about 
Gauge. So, this testing framework is used in "Specification by Example". The test steps are preferred to be written 
from a 'business' point of view. 

---

So, for this project you need to install Gauge, create a Gauge_Home folder and add 'GAUGE_HOME' sys environment in 
system variables. Install html-report, python and screenshot using `gauge install {package_name}`. Then test with 
`gauge --version`
```commandline
PS E:\Python\bitedender-interviu> gauge --version
